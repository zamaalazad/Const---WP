					The search for entrepreneur Tom Striven, missing for two days, has concluded. Police confirmed this morning that he has been found alive and well wandering around the South Base Camp of Mount Everest, in Nepal. The businessman apparently visited the site unexpectedly, amidst claims that his latest venture, High Tea Inc., was predicated on false information. He wanted to see it for himself, and flew to Nepal without informing his co-workers.
